# Week 1 Code Challenge "Toy Problems"

This repository includes basic JavaScript solutions for three fun problems: a salary tax calculator, a speed detector for cars, and a student grade calculator based on marks. The first challenge (grades) is designed to output in swahili assuming this code got to Tanzania.

### Grades generated for students

- **Documents**:
   - {`gradegenerator.html`}: An HTML file with a button to start calculating grades.
   - The JavaScript file with the function to compute and display the grade is called {`gradegenerator.js`}.

 - **Explanation of the anticipated outcome**:
 - The user of this program is prompted to enter student marks in the range of 0 to 100. It calculates and shows the appropriate grade based on the marks. The following will be the grading criteria:
 - A: More than 79 points - B: Between 60 and 79 points - C: Between 50 and 59 points - D: Between 40 and 49 points - E: Less than 40 points

- **Illustration on how to Use**:
  1. Start by opening {`gradegenerator.html`} in your browser using the Go Live button on VS Code
  2. Press the button marked "Ingiza Alama za Mwanafunzi".
  3. When asked, enter the student's marks.
  4. An alert box with the grade will appear.
  5. In the case the user doesnt follow instructions and inputs a number without the specified range and or a data type that is not a number and can not be converted, an alert message saying "Ingizo batili. Tafadhali ingiza namba kati ya 0(sufuri) na 100(mia moja)." will appear

  ## Example

- **Student Grades**:
  The message "Daraja la mwanafunzi ni: A" will appear if you enter a mark of 89.
